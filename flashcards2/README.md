# Web Development Project 3 - *Flashcards 2*

Submitted by: **Md Hossain**

This web app: **An interactive science flashcard application that tests users' knowledge across Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science, and Astronomy. Features a modern dark theme with floating science-themed particle animations, intelligent answer checking, progress tracking, and card shuffling capabilities.**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess into an input box *before* seeing the flipside of the card**
  - Application features a clearly labeled input box with a submit button where users can type in a guess
  - Clicking on the submit button with an **incorrect** answer shows visual feedback that it is wrong ("Try again!" in red)
  -  Clicking on the submit button with a **correct** answer shows visual feedback that it is correct ("Correct!" in green)
- [x] **The user can navigate through an ordered list of cards**
  - A forward/next button displayed on the card navigates to the next card in a set sequence when clicked
  - A previous/back button displayed on the card returns to the previous card in the set sequence when clicked
  - Both the next and back buttons have hover effects and visual feedback, preventing navigation beyond the first/last card

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] **Users can use a shuffle button to randomize the order of the cards**
  - Cards remain in the same sequence unless the shuffle button is clicked 
  - Cards change to a random sequence once the shuffle button is clicked using Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- [x] **A user's answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer**
  - Answers are considered correct even if they only partially match the answer on the card 
  - Features include: ignoring uppercase/lowercase discrepancies, ignoring punctuation discrepancies, accepting multiple variations of answers
  - Examples: "H2O", "h2o", "H‚ÇÇO" are all accepted for water; "carbon dioxide", "co2", "co‚ÇÇ" all work
- [ ] **A counter displays the user's current and longest streak of correct responses**
- [ ] **A user can mark a card that they have mastered and have it removed from the pool of displayed cards**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] **Professional Dark Theme**: Modern zinc-900 color scheme with gradient text effects
* [x] **Animated Science Particles**: Floating science-themed emojis (‚öõÔ∏èüß™üî¨üß¨‚öóÔ∏èüå°Ô∏èüíäü¶†‚≠ê) with random positioning and timing
* [x] **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing current position in the deck with "X of Y" counter
* [x] **Welcome Screen**: Engaging start page with gradient title and call-to-action button
* [x] **Difficulty Indicators**: Visual difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) displayed on cards
* [x] **Smart Answer Checking**: Intelligent matching with array of accepted answers per question
* [x] **Restart Functionality**: Ability to restart the entire session and reshuffle cards
* [x] **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded correct/incorrect responses with smooth transitions

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Features Breakdown

### Core Functionality
- **20 Science Questions** covering Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science, and Astronomy
- **Smart Answer Validation** with multiple accepted answer formats
- **Card Navigation** with previous/next buttons and visual feedback
- **Card Shuffling** using Fisher-Yates algorithm for true randomization
- **Progress Tracking** with visual progress bar and counter

### User Experience
- **Welcome Screen** with engaging introduction and science theme
- **Dark Professional Theme** with zinc-900 background and gradient text
- **Floating Particle Animation** with science-themed emojis
- **Smooth Transitions** and hover effects throughout the interface
- **Visual Feedback** for correct/incorrect answers
- **Responsive Design** that works on various screen sizes

### Technical Implementation
- **React Hooks** for state management (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **CSS Animations** for particles, card flips, and transitions
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **Component Architecture** with reusable Flashcard and Guess components
- **Smart Answer Normalization** removing punctuation and case sensitivity

## Notes

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **Z-index Management**: Ensuring floating particles stayed in background while keeping interactive elements accessible
2. **Animation Timing**: Synchronizing particle animations to appear seamless and random
3. **Answer Validation**: Implementing flexible answer checking that accepts multiple correct formats
4. **State Management**: Coordinating flip state, guess validation, and card navigation across components
5. **Responsive Design**: Balancing visual appeal with functionality across different screen sizes

### Technical Decisions:
- Chose Fisher-Yates shuffle for true randomization over simple Math.random() sorting
- Implemented accepted answers array for each question to handle multiple valid responses
- Used CSS keyframes for smooth particle animations rather than JavaScript-based animation
- Applied modern color palette (zinc-900) for professional appearance while maintaining readability

## Technologies Used
- **React 18** with Vite build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **CSS3** animations and keyframes
- **JavaScript ES6+** with modern React patterns
- **Component-based architecture** for modularity and reusability
